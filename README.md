# Color Clock

# color_clock is a python program that displays the time as both rgb values and the appearance of those values.

# The variables 'minimum' and 'maximum' represent the min and max rgb values that will act as the extremes for each cycle. Default is 0 and 255, respectively.
# The time between updates is calculated at startup, and takes into account the difference between the min and max rgb values, so the only changes that would need to be made by a user is to the min and max variables. The program will handle the time calculation appropriately.
